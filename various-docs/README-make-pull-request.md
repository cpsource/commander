Here's a comprehensive bash wrapper script for `commander.py` that handles the complete Git workflow! 

**Key features:**

1. **Validates prerequisites** - Checks for `commander.txt`, `commander.py`, Git repo, and GitHub CLI
2. **Creates new branch** - Creates and switches to the specified branch name
3. **Runs commander.py** - Automatically adds the `-y` flag for auto-confirmation
4. **Handles Git workflow** - Stages, commits, pushes, and creates PR
5. **Error handling** - Cleans up on failures and provides helpful messages
6. **Colored output** - Uses colors to make status messages clear

**Usage examples:**

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x git-commander.sh

# Basic usage
./git-commander.sh feature/update-docs

# With specific file extensions
./git-commander.sh fix/json-parsing -x 'py,json'

# Recursive processing
./git-commander.sh refactor/all-files -x 'py,js,html' -r
```

**Prerequisites:**
- `commander.txt` must exist
- `commander.py` must be in the current directory
- Git repository must be initialized
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated

**What it does step-by-step:**
1. âœ… Validates all prerequisites
2. ðŸŒ¿ Creates new branch and switches to it
3. ðŸ¤– Runs `python commander.py [args] -y`
4. ðŸ“¦ Stages all changes with `git add .`
5. ðŸ’¾ Commits using `commander.txt` as the commit message
6. ðŸš€ Pushes branch to remote
7. ðŸ”€ Creates GitHub pull request

Think of it like a complete "autopilot" for your code modification workflow - you just specify the branch name and file types, and it handles everything from branch creation to PR submission!

The script also includes safety checks and will clean up if anything goes wrong, switching you back to your original branch.
