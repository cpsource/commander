Perfect! I've created two separate bash scripts from your original `make-pull-request.sh`:

## **prepare-pull-request.sh**
This script handles the **preparation phase**:
- âœ… Validates prerequisites (commander.txt, commander.py, Git repo)
- ðŸŒ¿ Creates and switches to new branch
- ðŸ¤– Runs commander.py with auto-confirm (-y)
- ðŸ›‘ **Exits after commander.py completes**

**Usage:**
```bash
./prepare-pull-request.sh feature/my-changes
./prepare-pull-request.sh fix/bug -x 'py,json' -r
```

## **complete-pull-request.sh**
This script handles the **completion phase**:
- ðŸ“¦ Stages all changes (`git add .`)
- ðŸ’¾ Commits using commander.txt as message
- ðŸš€ Pushes branch to remote
- ðŸ”€ Creates GitHub pull request
- ðŸŽ¯ **No arguments needed** - works with current branch

**Usage:**
```bash
./complete-pull-request.sh
```

## **Workflow Example:**
```bash
# Step 1: Prepare the changes
./prepare-pull-request.sh feature/awesome-updates -x 'py,md'

# Review the changes made by commander.py
git diff
ls -la

# Step 2: Complete the pull request
./complete-pull-request.sh
```

**Key improvements:**
- **Two-phase workflow** lets you review changes before committing
- **Better error handling** in complete script (checks for feature branch, existing changes)
- **Auto-detects base branch** (main vs master)
- **Robust validation** ensures prerequisites are met
- **Clear status messages** show exactly what each script is doing

Think of it like a two-stage rocket - the first stage gets you into orbit (prepares changes), then you can inspect everything before the second stage takes you to your destination (creates the PR)!
