Good question! Yes, you **can** push to a remote even if you cloned with HTTPS, but it depends on your authentication setup.

**If you have authentication configured:**
- **Personal Access Token (PAT)** stored in Git credential manager
- **GitHub CLI authenticated** (which the script already checks for)
- **SSH keys set up** (even though you cloned with HTTPS)

Then `git push` will work fine.

**If you don't have authentication set up:**
The `git push` command will fail with an authentication error.

**Here's how to modify the script to handle this gracefully:**

```bash
# Step 12: Push branch to remote
print_status "ðŸš€ Pushing branch to remote..."
if git push -u origin "$BRANCH_NAME" 2>/dev/null; then
    print_success "Branch pushed to remote"
else
    print_warning "Failed to push branch to remote (authentication required)"
    print_warning "You can push manually later with: git push -u origin $BRANCH_NAME"
    
    # Ask if user wants to continue with local-only workflow
    read -p "Continue without pushing? (y/N): " -n 1 -r
    echo
    if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
        print_error "Operation cancelled"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    print_warning "Skipping pull request creation (branch not pushed)"
    print_success "âœ¨ Local workflow completed!"
    echo "Branch '$BRANCH_NAME' created and committed locally"
    exit 0
fi
```

**Quick authentication setup options:**
```bash
# Option 1: Use GitHub CLI to set up credentials
gh auth login

# Option 2: Set up a Personal Access Token
git config --global credential.helper store
# Then push once and enter your PAT when prompted
```

Think of it like having a key to your house - you can make changes inside (local commits), but you need the key (authentication) to share those changes with the outside world (remote push).

Would you like me to update the script with this more robust error handling?
