Perfect! I've added the `-y` switch to the commander.py script. Here's what changed:

**Key modifications:**

1. **Added `-y/--yes` argument** to the argument parser with help text
2. **Updated the usage documentation** to include the new `-y` flag
3. **Modified the confirmation block** to check for the `args.yes` flag:
   - If `-y` is present: skips the input prompt and proceeds automatically
   - If `-y` is not present: shows the normal confirmation prompt

**Usage examples:**

```bash
# Normal operation with confirmation prompt
python commander.py -x "py,json"

# Skip confirmation and proceed automatically
python commander.py -x "py,json" -y

# Recursive with auto-confirm
python commander.py -r -y

# All flags together
python commander.py -r -x "js,html,css" -y
```

Think of the `-y` flag like adding "auto-pilot" to your file processing - it removes the human checkpoint and lets the script run straight through to completion. This is especially useful for automated scripts or when you're confident about the changes being made.

The script will now show a clear message when auto-confirming: **"Auto-confirming file modifications (--yes flag provided)"** so you know it skipped the prompt.
